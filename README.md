Hello and welcome to the Server Saver App!

Being a server/bartender in restaurants for many years, I have noticed a pattern looking at my coworkers. For the most part, we are bad with money. The instant cash in hand at the end of every shift can make it hard for those in the service industry to budget and save.
I wanted to build a server to help those in the service industry track their tips as well as allocate their tips towards financial goals. 

Thus, Server Saver was born!

Enjoy the app and let me know any feedback. Keep in mind this server is a work in progress.

Dev,

Corey Tyler
